# PPC Lookup

This is a reimagining/reimplementation of an older project (located [here](https://github.com/jmarkman/protectCodeLookup/))

Instead of dealing with connecting to a server, it's just easier and a little bit faster to have a underlying SQLite database to query and update as needed. Less convenient than being able to edit values from a master table that all users have to query, but easier than waiting an eon for the IT company to make a read-only dummy account.
